2023-07-25 10:47:03,931 Report Title%%% Optimizing Website Speed and Mobile Optimization for Improved Conversions at LIONSENTRY

2023-07-25 10:47:03,931 Company Description%%% LIONSENTRY is a self-discovery and empowerment organization dedicated to helping individuals unlock their potential, discover their purpose, and become the best versions of themselves. The company provides resources designed to help clients comprehend their true purpose and manifest their dreams, thereby creating a positive impact on mankind. One of their key offerings includes a survey that aids in generating a powerful "Why Statement" for clients, revealing their essential motivations and life purpose. This process is believed to lay the foundation for personal growth and self-improvement. LIONSENTRY also hosts a community for individuals on this journey of self-realization and offers personalized support through their office based in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

2023-07-25 10:47:03,931 KPI Used To Measure Problem%%% The primary KPI for LIONSENTRY should be Conversion Rate: The percentage of visitors who complete the survey or contact the company. This is crucial to understand how well the landing page is motivating the audience to undertake desired actions.

1/ Time on Page: This metric while useful, doesn't necessarily mean that visitors are taking desired actions; a long average time might mean visitors are puzzled, not engaged. 

2/ Click-Through Rate (CTR): Visitors might click links/buttons, indicating interest, but taking no further action isn't profitable for LIONSENTRY. We want completion, not merely exploration.

3/ Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): Though important, it's secondary to conversion. High CAC can be bearable if the conversion rate is high, but a low conversion rate is problematic regardless of CAC. Thus, it's not the primary KPI.

2023-07-25 10:47:03,931 Hypothesis%%% Based on the information available and the specific problem of a high bounce rate on the landing page, I propose the hypothesis: "Improving Site Speed and Mobile Optimization: If the landing page takes too long to load or doesn't display properly on mobile devices, that could contribute to a high bounce rate. Optimizing both these aspects might help retain more visitors and improve conversions."

If a website takes too long to load or doesn't provide an optimal user experience on mobile devices, users are likely to abandon the page before they even gain an understanding of the service being providedâ€” in this case, the survey that helps generate a potent "Why Statement". This situation negatively impacts the bounce rate and, subsequently, the conversion rate.

Therefore, improvements in site speed and mobile optimization could significantly reduce the bounce rate and increase the time spent on the page, giving visitors enough time to understand the value being provided, potentially leading them to complete the survey (thereby acting on the website's primary call to action). This would lead to an improved conversion rate, effectively countering the current issue faced by LIONSENTRY. Remember, in today's digital environment, user experience is crucial, and any deterrents such as slow site speed or poor mobile optimization can lead to high bounce rates.

2023-07-25 10:47:03,931 Recommended Test%%% Given the hypothesis "Improving Site Speed and Mobile Optimization," I recommend performing an A/B Test. The test will involve creating two versions of the landing page - one as it currently exists and another optimized for speed and mobile use. We can then measure the bounce rate, time spent on the page, and completion of the site's primary call to action in both versions to determine if the optimized version contributes to better user engagement and higher conversions. 

A/B Testing holds an edge over alternative tests such as Heatmap Test and Scroll Tracking in this context. While Heatmap Test can provide insights into how users interact with your page, it doesn't directly address the potential issues of site speed and mobile optimization. Scroll Tracking, on the other hand, can tell you how far people scroll on your page, but it doesn't provide insights into why they left without converting. A/B Testing, however, directly tests the impact of improvements in site speed and mobile optimization on user behavior, providing concrete data on the hypothesis. 

I'll include this recommended test in the report below:

'Recommended Test': 'A/B Testing on Landing Page',
'What We Can Expect To Learn': 'With this A/B test, we aim to identify whether improvements in site speed and mobile optimization can reduce the bounce rate, increase the time spent on the landing page, and improve the completion of the site's primary call-to-action.',
'How To Perform Test': 'Firstly, create a version of the landing page that's optimized for speed and mobile use. Then, split the site's visitors evenly between the current landing page and the optimized version. Over a predetermined period, compare the bounce rate, time spent on the page, and primary call-to-action completion between the two versions. Use these observations to determine the effectiveness of the optimization and whether it leads to improved user engagement and higher conversion rates.'

2023-07-25 10:47:03,931 What We Can Expect To Learn%%% Based on the test outlined in your report, we aim to learn whether improvements in site speed and optimization for mobile use directly impact the bounce rate, time spent on landing page, and completion of the site's primary call-to-action. Essentially, the test is looking to identify if making your website load faster and look better on mobile devices will retain more visitors and lead them to take desired actions, like completing the survey to generate their "Why Statement".

The A/B test will be used to validate or invalidate your hypothesis. By creating two versions of your landing page - one as it currently exists (control) and the other optimized for speed and mobile-usage (variant) - we will compare key metrics (bounce rate, time spent on the page, completion of call-to-action) between them.

If the variant performs better compared to the control, your hypothesis will be validated. This means that improving site speed and mobile optimization effectively reduces the bounce rate, increases visitor retention, and enhances conversion rates.

On the other hand, if there is no significant difference in performance or the variant performs worse, your hypothesis will be invalidated. This would mean that site speed and mobile optimization may not be the predominant factors affecting high bounce rates and low conversion rates. In that case, further investigation will be needed to understand other potential reasons why visitors are leaving the site without completing the primary call-to-action. 

The use of an A/B test in this scenario provides a data-driven avenue to test the hypothesis directly, helping to understand the exact impact of the proposed solutions on user behavior.

2023-07-25 10:47:03,931 How To Perform Test%%% To perform the recommended A/B test in a tool-agnostic way, you can follow the steps:

1. **Set your hypothesis:** Based on the details in your report, your hypothesis states that improving the site's speed and mobile optimization will reduce the bounce rate and increase the completion of your website's primary call-to-action (completing the survey). 

2. **Identify key metrics:** The key metrics to track would be the bounce rate, time spent on the page, and rate of completion for your primary call-to-action.

3. **Create two versions of the landing page:** Version A will be your current landing page (control), and Version B will be the improved landing page that addresses the problems in your hypothesis (variant). 

4. **Split your website's traffic:** Aim to divide an evenly distributed segment of your website's visitors between both versions. It's vital for the selection process to be random to avoid bias. 

5. **Run the test:** Allow both versions of the landing page to run simultaneously for a fixed period. It's important to ensure this period is long enough to capture adequate data but not so long that external factors could potentially influence the results.

6. **Analyze the data:** After your testing period, compare the key metrics (bounce rate, time spent on the page, completion of call-to-action) of both versions. 

7. **Decide whether to reject or accept your hypothesis:** If Version B outperforms Version A significantly in the critical metrics, you accept your hypothesis. If there's no notable difference or Version B performs worse, you reject your hypothesis. 

To ensure your data is clean and reliable, take the following steps:

1. **Data Validation:** Ensure that the data collected is accurate and relevant by cross-checking with different sources.

2. **Remove Outliers:** Identify and manage outliers which can skew your results. 

3. **Handle Missing Data:** In the event of missing data, decide whether to discard the data point or to replace the missing value with a suitable substitute such as the mean, median, or mode.

4. **Check for Consistency:** Cross-verify and apply consistency checks to ensure that the same metric is measured and calculated in the same way across both landing pages. 

By following these steps, you can perform the A/B test to validate or invalidate your hypothesis and ensure the data driving your decisions is clean and reliable.
