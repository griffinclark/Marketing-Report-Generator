2023-07-25 14:28:38,627 Problem Description%%% The bounce rate on my landing page is super high

2023-07-25 14:28:38,627 Report Title%%% Reducing Bounce Rate by Simplifying the 'Why Statement' Explanation

2023-07-25 14:28:38,627 Company Description%%% LIONSENTRY is a company that focuses on personal development and self-discovery. They provide resources and tools designed to help individuals identify their purpose in life and harness their potential. In this endeavor, they aim to foster positive impact on humanity. One of their key offerings includes generating personalized "Why Statements," driven by the responses provided by the individuals in a survey. They believe this statement can be a powerful tool in helping a person understand their unconscious drivers and align their actions accordingly. The company's operations are based out of Tulsa, Oklahoma.

2023-07-25 14:28:38,627 KPI Used To Measure Problem%%% The primary KPI for measuring the problem would be the Exit Rate as it specifically gauges the proportion of individuals who leave the site directly from the landing page.

- Bounce Rate would not be as useful because it doesn't distinguish between users who left the page immediately and those who left after spending significant time exploring.
  
- Conversion Rate wouldn't be the most relevant KPI here because the current problem at hand is the high number of people leaving the page without engaging, not necessarily the conversion of the ones who stay.

- Scroll Depth, though valuable in understanding engagement with the page, wouldn't serve too well in this context because a user can scroll through the page without truly engaging or retaining any of the content.

2023-07-25 14:28:38,627 Hypothesis%%% Based on the business details and the given problem, the hypothesis that seems most accurate is "Improving the 'Why Statement' Explanation: The explanation of how to generate the 'Why Statement' is lengthy and could be intimidating for potential participants. Make it simpler and more engaging to encourage the visitors to follow through."

Considering the nature of LIONSENTRY's services, which focus on personal development and self-discovery, it becomes crucial to make the process as simple and approachable as possible. A complex explanation might lead visitors to feel overwhelmed or even doubt their ability to undertake this self-discovery journey, hence they bounce. By simplifying the explanation and providing more engaging content, you would decrease the intimidation or confusion factor, encourage visitors to follow through with the 'Why Statement' process, and thus lower the bounce rate.

Remember, customers in the personal development sector often seek clarity, ease, and accessibility. Anything that complicates their journey might turn them away or make them seek alternate resources. An intimidating or confusing 'Why Statement' explanation directly conflicts with the simplicity they seek. Hence, focusing on this area could effectively handle the high bounce rate and increase the engagement on your website.

2023-07-25 14:28:38,627 Recommended Test%%% I recommend employing the Simplified Explanation Test. The current hypothesis purports that the complexity of the 'Why Statement' explanation is deterring users from staying on the website. This test aims to simplify the explanation and assess whether it decreases the bounce rate. This approach is more direct in addressing the crux of the problem compared to the A/B Testing of Page Layout and Impact of Site Speed. The page layout might influence the bounce rate independently of the 'Why Statement' explanation, making it a less focused test. Similarly, site speed could affect all site pages, not just the one with the 'Why Statement'. The Simplified Explanation Test directly addresses the hypothesis, ensuring a more definitive conclusion regarding the effectiveness of a simpler explanation.

2023-07-25 14:28:38,627 What We Can Expect To Learn%%% From the test you've outlined - The Simplified Explanation Test - you are expecting to learn how making the 'Why Statement' explanation simpler and more engaging affects user interaction with your website and whether or not this change mitigates the high bounce rate on your landing page.

If after implementing a simplified explanation, the exit rate decreases, it will validate your hypothesis that the complexity of the 'Why Statement' explanation was indeed causing users to leave the site prematurely.

On the other hand, if the exit rate remains the same or even increases, it will invalidate your hypothesis and suggest that other factors might be contributing to the high bounce rate. In this case, further investigation would be required to identify the root causes behind high bounce rates, possibly involving A/B testing of page layout or delving deeper into site speed aspects. 

The test itself is outlined to directly address the hypothesis - making it a strong approach to validating your assumptions. It ensures that the insights drawn are directly related to the changes implemented based on your original hypothesis.

2023-07-25 14:28:38,627 How To Perform Test%%% Performing the Simplified Explanation Test involves the following steps:

1. **Revamp Explanation Content:** Your task is to substantially simplify the process of generating a 'Why Statement'. You can do so by breaking down the process into smaller, digestible steps, using simpler language and possibly including some visuals. Remember, the goal is to make the explanation more engaging and less intimidating for first-time visitors.

2. **Implement the New Version on Site:** Once you have the simplified content ready, replace the old content in your website with the new one. Make sure the new content aligns well with the overall aesthetic and UX design of your site.

3. **Split-Test:** You could split test this by having half of the website traffic be redirected to the previous version while the other half is presented with the new explanation. This'll give you a good comparison of performance.

4. **Track the Exit Rate:** Monitor exit rate on your landing page post-implementation. This is your key indicator of whether the revised content is appealing to visitors and encouraging them to stay.

5. **Statistical Evaluation:** You'll want to evaluate the results taking statistical significance into consideration. For example, if the bounce rate has decreased and p-value is less than 0.05, it's usually considered significant. 

In terms of data cleanliness, you'll want to:

- **Define and Implement Data Collection Standards:** Ensure that all collected data adheres to predefined rules or standards. Inconsistent data can lead to inaccurate results.

- **Filter Out Irrelevant Information:** Remove or filter out any data that does not contribute to your cause (e.g. bot traffic, irrelevant user segments).

- **Check for Accuracy:** Regularly cross-check and validate the accuracy of your data against predefined standards or expectations.

- **Look for Inconsistencies and Address Them:** Be it manual entry errors, duplicated entries, or anomalies, these inconsistencies should be detected and resolved to maintain the integrity of your dataset.

- **Ensure Regular Updates:** Continually update your dataset to include the most recent information. Old, outdated records can often lead to incorrect assumptions and decisions.
