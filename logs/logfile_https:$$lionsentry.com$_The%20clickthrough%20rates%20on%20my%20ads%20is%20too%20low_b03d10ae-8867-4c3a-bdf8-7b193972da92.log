2023-07-25 10:54:06,177 Report Title%%% Increasing Clickthrough Rates at LIONSENTRY: Personalization of Ads

2023-07-25 10:54:06,177 Company Description%%% LIONSENTRY is a company dedicated to helping people discover their life purpose and unlock their innate potential. They focus on self-discovery, empowerment, and personal development, aiming to create a positive impact on humanity. The organization provides resources designed to guide individuals in understanding their purpose and shaping their future in alignment with their dreams. As part of their service, they offer a survey that aids users in deriving the most powerful 'Why Statement', which is a succinct statement of their purpose or fundamental driving forces. Recognizing that these answers are already present within each person unconsciously, LIONSENTRY encourages individuals to trust themselves during the process. The company also provides a community space to support individuals on their journey.

2023-07-25 10:54:06,177 KPI Used To Measure Problem%%% The primary KPI for LIONSENTRY should be the Conversion Rate. This will measure the percentage of people who complete the desired action (completing the survey and generating 'Why Statement') after clicking on your ads, which directly correlates with your problem of low clickthrough rates.

1/ Click-Through Rate (CTR): While important, CTR doesn’t guarantee that people completing the action you want (completing the survey). It is possible to have a high CTR but a low conversion rate if the ads aren't accurately representing what users will get.

2/ Cost per Click (CPC): This is a valuable metric for budgeting and understanding how much you’re paying for visitors to arrive at your site. However, a low CPC with a low conversion rate doesn't necessarily indicate success as it means you're attracting the wrong audience.

3/ Ad Impressions: This only indicates the total number of times people saw your advertisement. It doesn't provide any actionable insight or indicate whether those impressions led to the desired actions (completing the survey).

2023-07-25 10:54:06,178 Hypothesis%%% Given the nature of the services offered by LIONSENTRY, which revolve around self-discovery, empowerment, and personal development, the hypothesis "Personalization of Ads" might be most accurate. The hypothesis states: "The ad content could be personalized to target users' interests and behavior. This will make the ads more relevant, potentially increasing the clickthrough rates."

Personalization can prove to be a powerful tool in this scenario. By tailoring the content of the ads to resonate with individuals' aspirations, interests, and personal growth journeys, LIONSENTRY can effectively capture their attention. As the services focus on self-discovery and understanding one's purpose, ads which reflect this and align with potential customers' self-perception and personal growth goals are likely to stimulate interest and engagement.

Furthermore, as people's motivations for engaging in personal development and self-discovery are inherently individual, personalizing the ads allows to tap into these unique drivers, making the ads more impactful and potentially increasing clickthrough rates.

Moreover, the usage of AI virtual assistant to provide personalized conversations based on user's input can make interaction more engaging, eventually leading to higher conversion rates. This technology allows improving people's online experiences by providing personalized attention and contextually relevant information.

Considering the KPI of Conversion Rate, personalization of ads could leverage this. Conversions are not solely based on click rates, and personalization could lead to more meaningful engagement past the initial click, further driving up Conversion Rates.

2023-07-25 10:54:06,178 Recommended Test%%% The Behavioral Targeting test is the recommended option for addressing the identified problem of low clickthrough rates. This test involves customizing ads based on users' behaviors, like their browsing history, clicked links, and past purchases. By tapping into patterns of behavior, your advertisements can more effectively draw each viewer's interest, driving up clickthrough rates. Behavioral targeting offers specific, precise personalization that captures individual interests distinctly. This level of personalization creates a highly engaging viewer-ad experience, unlike the Interest-based Targeting test, which casts a broader, less tailored net by targeting ads based on general user interests. At the same time, the AI-based Personalized Ads test, while cutting-edge, may not be as reliable due to potential issues with AI errors and user discomfort with over-personalization. Thus, the Behavioral Targeting test strikes a balance between accuracy and personalization degrees, making it the most promising test.

2023-07-25 10:54:06,178 What We Can Expect To Learn%%% Based on your outlined test, which involves Behavioral Targeting, you will expect to learn about the effectiveness of using past user behaviors (such as browsing history and clicked links) to personalize your advertisements. Considering your hypothesis revolves around the idea of increasing ad engagement and clickthrough rates through personalized ad content, this test will potentially offer insight into whether this level of personalization proves effective. 

To be specific, here's what we can expect to learn from the test:

1. The correlation between ad personalization based on past user behavior and clickthrough rates.
2. User acceptance and interaction with personalized ads.
3. The user patterns or behaviors that lead to higher engagement and clickthroughs than others. 
4. The conversion rate, i.e., how many of these clickthrough users completed the desired action (completing the survey and generating 'Why Statement').

As a method to validate or invalidate your hypothesis, this test will provide data-backed insight. If the clickthrough rates improve after implementing the behavioral targeting method, it shows that personalization based on user behavior indeed increases ad engagement, validating your hypothesis. Conversely, if there's no significant increase in clickthrough rates, this would suggest that personalization might not be the key contributor to ad engagement, invalidating your hypothesis.

However, it's worth noting that even if this test doesn't directly increase your clickthrough rates, the insight it provides about user behavior and engagement can still be highly valuable for future marketing tactics.

2023-07-25 10:54:06,178 How To Perform Test%%% To perform the Behavioral Targeting test, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify your audience:** Identify potential users who are likely to be interested in your service. These could be individuals who have shown interest in personal development and self-discovery platforms in the past.

2. **Track User Behavior:** Use an analytics tool to track the behavior of your audience. This includes their interactions with your ads, how they navigate your website, and their past browsing behavior.

3. **Create custom advertisements:** Based on the data you gathered in the previous step, customize your advertisements. Try to create them as personalized as possible, ensuring they align with your users' interests and past behavior.

4. **Measure Outcomes:** Measure the reaction and engagement rates of your ads. Track metrics such as click-through rates and conversion rates. Do a comparison of these metrics before and after the implementation of the behavioral targeting to infer the impact of personalization on your ads’ performance.

5. **Analyze Results:** Interpret the results and determine whether the personalized advertisements led to an increase in click-through and conversion rates.


To ensure your data is clean, follow these steps:

1. **Data inspection:** Thoroughly inspect your data and identify errors. It's important to scrutinize your data to ensure there are no incorrect entries, outliers, or missing values.

2. **Data cleaning:** Once you have identified errors in your data, clean them. This could involve removing duplicates, dealing with missing values, or correcting inconsistent entries.

3. **Data transformation:** Transform your data into a suitable format for analysis. Make sure your data is formatted consistently to avoid misinterpretations during analysis.

4. **Data validation:** Regularly validate your data to ensure it's up-to-date and accurate. Implement data validation checks to automate the process where possible.

Remember, dirty data can lead to misinterpretations in your test results, so it's crucial to invest time and resources in ensuring your data is clean.
